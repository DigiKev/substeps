Roadmap
=======

We're not done yet!! :-)

We've got a number of ideas and plans to enhance both the core capabilities of substeps and to add
 to the libraries of step implementations.
We'd love to hear any feedback, feature requests and of course, this being an open source project on github, pull requests!
 
Future plans include:
- More webdriver substeps
- Database and Email related susbtep libraries
- Better looking / functional reports
- More functionality in the eclipse plugin
- a maven archetype
- Colour output on the command line (for shells that support it)
- and many more....
